<p>Hi there! I am a doctoral candidate with research interests in applied econometrics, statistics, public finance, and quantitative finance. My working papers, which you can find below, propose new metrics for causal and comparative inference. They address practical problems with some ratios that are widely used for policy analysis. Comments and critiques are welcome. You can use the email addresses gkarapakula@gmail.com and vgk22@cam.ac.uk to contact me.</p>
